PHASE 2: Fix Comparison Slider Visualization

Fix the following 2 issues in the Comparison Slider:

ISSUE 1: Image Cropping in Comparison Slider
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM: In the comparison slider mode, images are cropped at the top, bottom, and sides.

SOLUTION:
WHEN displaying images in the comparison slider:
  CALCULATE the container height dynamically based on the image aspect ratio
  AND ensure both images (left and right) are fully visible without cropping
  AND maintain the original aspect ratio of the images
  
IF images have different aspect ratios:
  THEN use the taller image's height as the container height
  AND center the shorter image vertically
END IF

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Change CSS object-fit from "cover" to "contain"
2. Calculate container height using: containerHeight = containerWidth / imageAspectRatio
3. Apply the calculated height to the slider container
4. Ensure both left and right sides use the same container dimensions

CSS CHANGES:
.comparison-slider-image {
  object-fit: contain; /* NOT cover */
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}

.comparison-slider-container {
  height: auto; /* or calculated height */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}

JAVASCRIPT LOGIC:
- Get image natural width and height
- Calculate aspect ratio: aspectRatio = naturalWidth / naturalHeight
- Set container height: containerHeight = containerWidth / aspectRatio
- Update container style dynamically

ISSUE 7: Incorrect Original in Comparison Slider
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM: The comparison slider always uses the first uploaded image as the "original" (left side).

SOLUTION:
CHANGE the comparison slider logic to use the "Use as Base" image:

WHEN displaying the comparison slider:
  LEFT SIDE (Original/Base):
    IF user has selected an image via "Use as Base":
      THEN display that image as the original
      AND add a label "Base" below the image
    ELSE:
      THEN display the first uploaded image (default behavior)
      AND add a label "Original" below the image
    END IF
  
  RIGHT SIDE (Edited/Generated):
    DISPLAY the currently selected image from Edit History
    OR the most recently generated image
    AND add a label "Edit" or "Generated" below the image
    AND show the prompt used for this edit below the label

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Track which image is set as "base" in the application state (baseImageUrl)
2. Pass the baseImageUrl to the comparison slider component as a prop
3. Update the slider's left side to use baseImageUrl instead of always using the first image
4. Add event listener to update the slider when "Use as Base" is clicked

STATE MANAGEMENT:
- Add baseImageUrl to the component state or context
- Update baseImageUrl when user clicks "Use as Base"
- Pass baseImageUrl to ComparisonSlider component

UI ENHANCEMENTS:
- Add labels below each side of the slider: "Base" (left) and "Edit" (right)
- Show the edit prompt below the right side
- Style labels with subtle background and padding
