ISSUE 2: Editor State Loss on Navigation
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM: When navigating from "Image Editor" to "Gallery" and back, all editor changes are lost.

SOLUTION:
IMPLEMENT state caching using localStorage with the following logic:

WHAT TO CACHE (per project):
1. Edit History (array of all edited images)
2. Current base image reference
3. Text in the "Generate" input field
4. State of "Overwrite Last Save" toggle
5. Currently selected image in Edit History

CACHE DATA STRUCTURE:
{
  projectId: string,
  editHistory: Array<{url: string, prompt: string, timestamp: number}>,
  currentBaseImageUrl: string,
  generateInputText: string,
  overwriteToggleState: boolean,
  selectedImageIndex: number,
  lastUpdated: timestamp
}

WHEN TO SAVE CACHE:
- After every edit generation
- When user changes base image via "Use as Base"
- When user types in the "Generate" field (debounced, every 500ms)
- When user toggles "Overwrite Last Save"
- Before navigating away from the editor

WHEN TO LOAD CACHE:
- When user navigates to the Image Editor page
- Check if there's cached data for the current project_id
- If yes, restore all cached state
- If no, start with fresh state

WHEN TO CLEAR CACHE:
- When user manually starts a new project (clicks "New Project" or "Upload New Image")
- DO NOT clear on logout (keep it persistent in localStorage)

STORAGE KEY FORMAT:
localStorage key: `photo_editor_state_${project_id}`

ISSUE 4: Incorrect Base Image in Edit History
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM: Edit History shows a stock photo instead of the actual uploaded base image.

SOLUTION:
DEBUG and fix the Edit History rendering logic:

WHEN initializing Edit History:
  ENSURE the first item is always the actual uploaded original image
  VERIFY the image URL points to the correct uploaded file (not a placeholder or stock photo)
  
CHECK the following potential causes:
1. Is the original image URL correctly stored in the database?
2. Is the image URL being correctly fetched from the database?
3. Is there a default/placeholder image being used when the URL is missing?
4. Is the image being correctly passed to the Edit History component?

FIX:
IF original_image_url is null or undefined:
  THEN fetch it from the database using the project_id or image_id
  AND set it as the first item in Edit History
ELSE:
  THEN use the existing original_image_url
END IF

ADD DEBUG LOGGING:
- Log the original image URL when fetched from database
- Log the Edit History array before rendering
- Log any errors in image loading

ENSURE the Edit History component receives the correct original image URL as a prop.

ISSUE 5: Non-Interactive Quick Suggestions
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM: Quick Suggestions are not clickable; users must manually copy/paste.

SOLUTION:
MAKE Quick Suggestions clickable with the following behavior:

WHEN user clicks on a Quick Suggestion:
  GET the current text in the "Generate" input field
  IF the input field is empty:
    THEN set the input field value to the suggestion text
  ELSE:
    THEN append the suggestion text to the existing text with a space separator
    EXAMPLE: existing text = "make it brighter", suggestion = "add warm tones"
    RESULT: "make it brighter add warm tones"
  END IF
  AND move the cursor to the end of the input field
  AND focus the input field

UI CHANGES:
- Add cursor: pointer to Quick Suggestion items
- Add hover effect (e.g., background color change on hover)
- Add visual feedback on click (e.g., brief highlight animation)

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Add onClick handler to each suggestion element
- Use ref to access the input field and update its value
- Trigger the input field's onChange event to update state
