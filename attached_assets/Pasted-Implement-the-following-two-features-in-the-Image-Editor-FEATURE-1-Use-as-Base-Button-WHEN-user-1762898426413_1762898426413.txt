Implement the following two features in the Image Editor:

FEATURE 1: "Use as Base" Button
WHEN user clicks the "Use as Base" button on any image in the Edit History
THEN set that image as the new base image for future edits
AND keep all existing Edit History intact (do not clear it)
AND all subsequent edits will be applied to this new base image instead of the original uploaded image
AND visually indicate in the UI which image is currently being used as the base

FEATURE 2: "Save" Button with Overwrite Toggle
ADD a toggle switch labeled "Overwrite Last Save" positioned to the right of the "Edit History" heading, above all image thumbnails

WHEN user clicks the "Save" button on any image in the Edit History
THEN check the state of the "Overwrite Last Save" toggle
IF toggle is ON:
  THEN find the most recently saved image from this project in the database (ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1)
  AND update that database record with the current image being saved
  AND preserve the original created_at timestamp
  AND update the updated_at timestamp to now
  AND show a toast notification: "Previous save overwritten"
  NOTE: If the most recently saved image is the original uploaded image (the base), overwrite it anyway
ELSE (toggle is OFF):
  THEN create a new record in the database
  AND save the current image as a new entry
  AND link it to the current project
  AND show a toast notification: "Saved as new image"
END IF

UI REQUIREMENTS:
1. Add "Use as Base" button to each image card in the Edit History
2. Add "Save" button to each image card in the Edit History
3. Add a toggle switch labeled "Overwrite Last Save" positioned to the right of the "Edit History" heading
4. The toggle should be OFF by default
5. When an image is set as base via "Use as Base", add a visual indicator (e.g., a badge saying "Current Base")
6. Show which images have been saved to the database (e.g., a cloud icon or "Saved" badge)

DATABASE SCHEMA:
Ensure the images table has the following relevant fields:
- id (primary key)
- project_id (foreign key)
- user_id (foreign key)
- image_url (string)
- is_base (boolean) - indicates if this is the original uploaded image
- created_at (timestamp)
- updated_at (timestamp)

LOGIC CLARIFICATIONS:
- "Most recently saved image" means the image with the latest created_at timestamp in the database for this project
- Edit History is an in-memory/session list of all edits made during the current editing session
- When "Use as Base" is clicked, it does NOT save to database automatically, it only changes which image is used for future edits
- When "Save" is clicked, it saves the selected image from Edit History to the database
